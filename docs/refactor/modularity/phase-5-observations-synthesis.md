# Phase 5 — Observation & Synthesis Layer

Part of [../modularity-plan.md](../modularity-plan.md). Implements the model in
[observation-and-correlation-model.md](observation-and-correlation-model.md), proven against
dump-only sessions. Depends on [phase-4-session-orchestration.md](phase-4-session-orchestration.md).

## Goal

Migrate analyzers to emit observations, move finding generation from hand-written per-analyzer
generators to synthesis rules, and **collapse the ~30 bespoke trend comparers into one generic
differ**. All of this happens while dumps are still the only source — deliberately, so the model is
validated under known conditions before trace depends on it.

## Why this phase is before trace

The observation model is the fusion substrate. If it lands *with* trace, two unproven things ship
at once and failures are hard to attribute (is the correlation wrong because the model is wrong, or
because trace ingest is wrong?). Landing it first, where existing dump findings provide an exact
expected output, makes it verifiable: **every finding the tool produces today must still be
produced, unchanged, through the new path.**

## Work

1. **Emit observations alongside domain results.** Each analyzer gains observation emission via
   `IObservationSink`; domain results stay untouched. Additive, no behavior change.
2. **Author synthesis rules** replacing each `IFindingGenerator`. Verified by golden-file equality
   against today's findings for the full test corpus — a finding that changes text or severity is a
   bug in this phase, not an improvement.
3. **Retire `IFindingGenerator`** once every generator has an equivalent rule.
4. **Generic trend differ.** Implement diffing over `(ObservationType, Subjects)` keyed by
   `TemporalExtent`, dispatching on `MeasureSemantics` (Absolute → delta/%; Rate → acceleration;
   Ratio → point difference; Count → growth-curve fit; Duration → distribution shift). Migrate
   trend comparers one domain at a time, verifying trend-report equality per domain.
5. **Keep the genuine exceptions.** Some comparers encode domain knowledge the generic differ
   can't — cases where "worse" isn't monotonic in the measure (thread count, handle count, where
   both directions can be bad in context). These stay as explicit rules. Expect roughly a handful,
   not thirty; if the count stays high, the measure semantics are under-specified and that's the
   real bug.
6. **Fold in `InsightEngine`.** Its cross-analyzer synthesis becomes multi-observation synthesis
   rules — same mechanism, wider match, no separate engine.
7. **Confidence plumbing.** Implement `ConfidenceBreakdown` with the caps from
   [observation-and-correlation-model.md § 4](observation-and-correlation-model.md) — identity
   fidelity, temporal alignment, capability fidelity. In a dump-only session most caps are 1.0, but
   building them now means Phase 7 turns them on rather than inventing them.

## Exit criteria

- Every analyzer emits observations; `ObservationStore` handles a full large-dump run within
  bounded memory (the model's key unvalidated assumption, now tested).
- Findings produced via synthesis rules are **byte-identical** to pre-phase findings across the
  golden corpus.
- Trend reports identical, with ≤ ~5 bespoke comparers remaining and each justified in writing.
- `IFindingGenerator` and `InsightEngine` no longer exist as separate concepts.
- Full observation lineage: every finding resolves to observations → analyzer → capabilities →
  artifact.

## Risk / effort

High effort, medium risk — mitigated almost entirely by the equality requirement. Because expected
output is exactly known, this is verifiable in a way most of the plan isn't.

Two real risks:
- **Observation volume on large dumps.** A dump with 40 M objects could produce far more
  observations than expected if analyzers emit per-object. Guidance: observations are *conclusions*,
  not records — per-object data stays in the index and is referenced via `EvidenceRef`, never
  copied into observations. If an analyzer wants to emit a million observations, that's a modeling
  error.
- **Temptation to improve findings while rewriting them.** Every "while we're here, this wording is
  better" breaks the equality check that makes this phase safe. Improvements land *after*, as
  separate changes.
